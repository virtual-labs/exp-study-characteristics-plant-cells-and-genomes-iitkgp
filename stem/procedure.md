## Procedure

Sample collection: Choose a fresh stem of a plant.

#### Sample Preparation: 
- Cut the stem from the selected plant
- Use a single edge blade to cut the stem transversely. 
- Hold the stem material between your thumb and index finger, such that the blade edge is parallel to the leafâ€™s longitudinal axis. Make very thin slices
- Using the edge of the blade, transfer these slices that carry the thin leaf section with the help of a brush into watch glass containing water. This helps maintain turgidity and prevents wilting during the observation.

#### Staining & Mounting:
- Use a pair of fine-pointed forceps to transfer the stem section onto a glass microscope slide.
- Add 2- 3 drops solution of safranin for 2-5 minutes. Safranin stains lignified and cutinized cell walls red.
- Rinse the sections briefly in distilled water to remove excess safranin.
- Add fast green for a few seconds to a minute. Fast green stains cellulose cell walls green.
- Rinse the section in distilled water.
- Add a drop of water to the leaf section to prevent drying out and to create a wet mount.
- Carefully place a coverslip over the leaf section, using a needle to gently lower it to and avoid trapping air bubbles.

#### Microscope Setup:
- Place the prepared slide on the stage of the simple microscope.
- Observe the section by turning the lowest magnification objective lens (usually 4x or 10x) and bring the sample into focus using the coarse and fine adjustment knobs.
- Once the sample is roughly in focus, switch to higher magnification objective lens (40x) to observe finer details of the internal cells of the stem.

#### Observation: 
- Move the slide around using the stage controls to explore different regions of the leaf section.
- Observe various structures such as epidermis, cambium, pith cells etc.
- Take note of cell shape, size, arrangement, and any distinct features like chloroplasts or cell walls.
